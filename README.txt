DESCRIPTION: A popular game which ends when someone reaches 10 points.
Collection of elements (table, buttons and results) are constant.
All elements that will be displayed on the site will exist all the time,
however they will be hidden or displayed depending on the needs.
During the game, we will apply for example the current game result
to the table by using events and modifying elements. The selection of a computer 
will be drawn by using the built-in 'random' function from the pool of possible choices.
